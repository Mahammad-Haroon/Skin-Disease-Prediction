# Skin Disease Detection Using CNN 🌿🌈

This project demonstrates the application of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built using **TensorFlow** to classify skin disease images. It features a clean web interface built using **Flask** and **JavaScript** to upload an image, run prediction, and display the result.

---

## 📈 Motivation

Skin is one of the most sensitive and visible organs of the body. Early detection of skin diseases can prevent major health issues. This project aims to provide a simple yet effective tool to identify potential skin conditions using a CNN model.

## 📅 Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-disease-detection.git
cd skin-disease-detection
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the application

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 4: Use the web interface

* Upload a skin image using the right panel
* Click the **"Detect"** button
* View prediction results on screen

## 🔧 Libraries and Tools Used

* **TensorFlow** – for building and training the CNN model
* **Flask** – for creating a lightweight backend server
* **JavaScript (JS)** – to handle user input, image upload, and interactivity on the frontend
* **HTML/CSS** – for structuring and styling the user interface

---

## 📊 Model Details

* CNN built using TensorFlow/Keras
* Trained on a skin disease dataset from Kaggle
* Model can classify common skin conditions (add details if known)
* Input: Skin disease image
* Output: Predicted class/condition

---

## 📊 Future Improvements

* Increase dataset size for better accuracy
* Include confidence score
* Add voice-based description of prediction
* Deploy on a cloud platform (e.g., Render, Heroku, or AWS)
